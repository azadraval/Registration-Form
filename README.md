# Registration Form Project

This is my registration form project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a comprehensive user registration form that collects various types of information using HTML form elements.

## Project Overview

The Registration Form project helped me learn how to create and style form elements to collect user information. The form includes various input types, validation, and styling to create a user-friendly experience.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Creating accessible form layouts with proper labeling
- Implementing different input types (text, email, password, radio buttons, etc.)
- Adding form validation with required fields and patterns
- Organizing related inputs with fieldsets and legends
- Styling form elements consistently
- Creating responsive forms that work on different devices
- Adding custom styling to standard form controls
- Implementing proper form submission actions

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure containing the form and all its input elements
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the form to make it visually appealing and user-friendly

## Design Elements

The form features:
- Clear section organization with fieldsets
- Consistent input styling
- Visual distinction between different types of inputs
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Validation indicators
- Hover and focus states for better usability
- Mobile-friendly layout adjustments

This project taught me the importance of well-designed forms in user experience. I learned that forms aren't just about collecting data but also about guiding users through a process in a clear and intuitive way.
